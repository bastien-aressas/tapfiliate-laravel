# Tapfiliate Laravel

Tapfiliate Laravel Package

This uses the Tapfiliate PHP Library that we published here:

https://github.com/llbbl/tapfiliate-php

It allows for easy integration with the Laravel Framework. It includes TapfiliateServiceProvider and Facades for the REST API endpoints. There is a new config file with an .env for the Tapfiliate API key.
